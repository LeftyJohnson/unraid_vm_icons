# unraid_vm_icons

Bash script to download custom icons for unRaid virtual machines

Based on the excellent work of SpaceinvaderOne https://github.com/SpaceinvaderOne/unraid_vm_icons

Requires the User Scipts plugin

Tested working on unRaid 6.12.x YMMV on all other versions


Just grab the contents of unraid_vm_icons.sh and paste them into a new script in the User Scripts plugin and run

Give it a schedule if you want to keep the icons up to date
